# Omnico Project 1 Evaluation for Dani Wood

### Python Script Functionality

- Your program successfully reads the CSV file, correctly converts the `session_duration` and `happiness_rating` values to integers, and properly updates the statistics dictionary.
- You accurately calculate the average happiness rating and average session duration for each algorithm. Your logic correctly identifies JoyStream as the algorithm with the highest average happiness and DeepPulse as the one with the longest average session duration.
- The final printed report is clear and formatted as specified in the example output, meeting all of the assignment requirements.

### Report File (report.md)

- Your report is well-organized and clearly outlines your methodology, results, and insights. It effectively explains the data analysis process step by step.
- The inclusion of observations regarding the performance differences between the algorithms demonstrates your analytical thought process.
- Overall, the report is professional and meets the project expectations.
