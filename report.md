## Introduction

[Understand File I/O, Parse CSV Data, Organize Data with Dictionaries]

## Methodology

[First, I defined session_duration and happiness_rating as integer values. Next, I created a loop that calculated the average duration and average happiness of each algorithm. Then, I created a loop to find the algorithm with the highest of each of those values. Finally, I printed the results. ]

## Results

- **Average Happiness Rating per Algorithm**

  - JoyStream: 8.5
  - SerenityFlow: 7.0
  - DeepPulse: 5.0

- **Total Number of Sessions per Algorithm**

  - JoyStream: 4
  - SerenityFlow: 3
  - DeepPulse: 3

- **Average Session Duration per Algorithm**

  - JoyStream: 37.5 minutes
  - SerenityFlow: 30.0 minutes
  - DeepPulse: 45.0 minutes

- **Highest and Lowest Performers**
  - Highest Average Happiness Rating: 8.5
  - Longest Average Session Duration: 45.0 minutes

## Observations and Insights

[JoyStream excels in happiness ratings with an average of 8.5. DeepPulse, while having the lowest happiness rating (5.0), has the longest average session duration (45 minutes), which suggests that longer engagement time leads to lower user satisfaction.]

## Conclusions and Recommendations

[JoyStream is the most effective algorithm for user happiness, with the highest average happiness rating (8.5). Analyze happiness trends across session durations.]
